1,0,1,After a week of careful preparation the colony is ready to begin the long trek to Big Spring. Three vehicles have been picked to make up the convoy: the school bus your customized roadster and a gasolene tanker that was salvaged from an old drilling site at nearby Greenville. Cutter and your uncle have rigged up a square canvas canopy to hide the tanker's tell-tale cylindrical body which now holds over 5000 gallons of petroleum siphoned from the underground storage tanks at the Ewell ranch. In this fuel-starved world gasolene is the most valuable of all commodities. If the city gangs were to discover that DC1 were transporting such a precious load they would stop at nothing to capture it.  Most of the colony will be travelling aboard the bus which will be driven by your uncle. Cutter will drive the tanker and you acting as scout will drive your roadster at the head of the convoy. With the bus full of passengers luggage is limited to essential supplies only; everything else will be destroyed before leaving McKinney. At dawn on the day before the convoy is to set off a thorough check is made of the vehicles and provisions. There is enough food and water to reach your destination but apart from your personal weapons the colony has very few firearms with which to defend itself.  Long Jake Bannerman a former roustabout from Gainsville has volunteered to drive north and search for weapons and ammunition. His brother once owned a hardware store in Sherman and kept his stock of sporting guns locked in the basement. Although they may have to be dug out there is a good chance that they have survived intact. Everyone agrees that it is worth a try and so Jake equipped with a CB radio a shovel and a rusty revolver sets out for Sherman in his beat-up old truck.  Two hours later he radios a message from Sherman. He has found rifles and ammunition but his truck has broken down and he is now stranded in the town. He has also found a survivor'a teenage girl'and he requests that you come to pick them up as soon as possible. Uncle Jonas agrees. He tells him to sit tight and wait for you to arrive.  'Trust Jake to go an' maroon hi'self with a gal!' grumbles Uncle Jonas wryly. 'Cal you better git your body up to Sherman and haul 'em back here. An' no messin' with street punks on the way y'hear!'  'We'll be back in time for breakfast!' you reply cheerily as you slide behind the wheel of your roadster and fire up its throaty V-8 engine. Then with a farewell wave you power the car out of McKinney and speed northwards to Sherman along what remains of Highway 75.

9,0,9,Your bullet hits home striking the machine gunner squarely in the chest and spinning him away from the window with the force of its impact. You breathe a little easier. Then a long burst of fire echoes from inside the building causing you to duck involuntarily. But this time you are in no immediate danger. Your single shot proved fatal and in the throes of death your enemy has emptied a full magazine into the walls and shattered ceiling of the drugstore.

109,0,109,You vault over the trunk and land feet-first in the driving seat your hand poised to switch on the ignition. The engine growls but before you can shift gears and speed away there is another burst of gunfire. It shatters the windshield and forces you to throw yourself across the passenger seat to avoid being caught in a deadly crossfire. Then a savage voice screams a command and the firing ceases. You chance a glance over the dashboard and see to your astonishment a leather-clad punk come running towards you from out of the ruins. Long Jake takes aim. He fires missing by a hand's breadth. Undeterred the grim-faced renegade leaps into the car beside you cackling like a maniac as he lunges for your throat with his flick knife.

The engine growls responsively but its powerful roar is all but drowned by a sudden eruption of gunfire. Bullets shatter the windshield forcing you to throw yourself across the passenger seat to avoid being caught in a deadly crossfire. Then a savage voice screams a command and the shooting ceases. You stay down and make a grab for the gear shift but before you can speed away a leather-clad punk leaps into the car beside you cackling like a maniac as he draws his knife.

204,0,204,The road stretches before you empty and silent shimmering beneath the early morning sun. With the temperature already in the mid-nineties you are grateful for the cool breeze that whips through your hair as you speed across the barren flats. The tracks made by Long Jake's tyres are still fresh in the dust that blankets the highway and you trail them all the way to the outskirts of Sherman where you discover his pick-up abandoned near an old gas station.  A line of footprints disappears towards the centre of the town and as you follow them along the main street you catch sight of Long Jake a rifle in his hand waving at you from the doorway of his brother's store. Behind him stands a girl. She looks eighteen maybe younger. Judging by the state of her clothing she must have been through a pretty rough time. You bring your roadster to a halt in front of the store and nervously Long Jake motions you to enter. 'Quick Cal!' he hisses. 'Get over here!'  You are barely out of the driving seat when a burst of machine gun fire rings out across the street. Bullets hit the ground near your feet and a number of holes appear stitched in a jagged row across the trunk of your car.

237,0,237,You glance over the wing of your car just long enough to pinpoint the muzzle flash; then you duck back and wait for a break in the firing. There is a sudden silence. You chance a second glance and spot a shadowy figure silhouetted in the window withdrawing an empty magazine.

251,0,251,An eerie silence is broken by Long Jake who shouts out '?'Taint over yet Cal. There's more of them damn peckerwoods hidin' out there somewhere!' As if to prove his point two single shots ring out almost simultaneously and ricochet off the storehouse wall. 'Watch your sides' Jake yells. 'Don't let 'em circle you.'  You sense someone or something moving among the ruined shops away to your right. They are trying to get into a position where they will have a clear shot at you. If you are to survive this ambush you had better find somewhere less exposed.

275,0,275,Your enemy's reactions are lightning fast. He throws himself down behind the window and your gunfire passes harmlessly through the now empty frame. (Remember to deduct the relevant number of rounds from your'Ammo Pouch.) An instant later the unexpected sound of running feet makes you spin on your heel. A leather-clad punk his skull shaved and sprayed with rings of metallic brown paint is charging at you from the ruins with a knife held high in his hand. You raise your weapon but before you can squeeze the trigger he dives full length and catches you in the chest with the crown of his head. His attack slams you backwards to the ground and gasping for breath you struggle to grab hold of his wrist before he can make use of his deadly blade.  Copperhead:'CLOSE'COMBAT'SKILL'14 ''ENDURANCE'24  Owing to the suddenness of his attack you must fight the first two rounds of combat unarmed and with your'CLOSE COMBAT SKILL'reduced by 2 points. If you are still alive at the start of the third combat round you will then be able to draw your Hunting Knife.

307,0,307,You throw yourself down your hand reaching automatically for a weapon even as you hit the ground. Then you roll over and over towards your car and take cover behind the engine compartment. Now the street is silent once more. With the blood pounding in your ears you force yourself to listen for a sound that will betray the whereabouts of your hidden attacker.  'He's in the drugstore!' shouts Long Jake his voice drawing another burst of fire from a building directly opposite.

329,0,329,The instant you set foot in the store two hands reach out of the darkness grab you by the jacket lapels and pull you away from the doorway. Immediately there is a long burst of fire and a hail of bullets scythes the air where you were standing only moments before.  'These ain't no ordinary punks' growls Long Jake peering cautiously over the edge of the bullet-shattered window frame. 'They're scouts for a Yankee gang that's headin' this way looking to take over. They're a mite anxious to get their hands on her too' he says nodding towards the girl who is crouching behind the store counter her eyes wide with fright.  'What do they want with her?' you ask but before Long Jake can reply there is a flash and a deafening explosion. The store's rear door is blown inwards and a searing wave of heat and flying debris knocks you off your feet. Stunned by the blast you rise unsteadily and reach for a weapon. A grey shape fills the rear entrance its outline fuzzy in the smoke and dust that hover there. Then the shape draws into focus and you see the silhouette of a tall man lean and sinewy his thin mouth set in a cruel sneer.  'Look out!' screams Long Jake as the figure leaps through the doorway a shotgun held before him ready to fire.  Pick a number from the'Random Number Table. If your current Shooting Stealth and Perception points (when added together) total 9 or more add 2 to the number you have picked.
